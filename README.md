# CardBot

A CLI tool for camera memory cards.

## DISCLAIMER - Built with AI

CardBot was built with the assistance of AI coding tools. This project is an experiment in using large language models to prototype and build an application in Go, a programming language I have minimal experience with. That will likely show throughout the codebase. Use this software at your own risk. There is no warranty — but does anything really have a warranty anymore? It should be the fastest ingestion tool in the West, though. Enjoy.

## What CardBot does

- Detects camera memory cards on macOS
- Generates an overview of card content (file count, type, dates, equipment data, etc.) 
- Copy modes: all, selects (starred), photos only, videos only, etc
- Rename files during copy operations
- Tracks card copy status

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| macOS | Uh huh | In Progress |
| Linux | I heard it works | Untested |
| Windows | Ugh | Someday, Maybe |

## CardBot's Codebase

- **~7 MB** installed binary (single static executable, no dependencies)
- **~8,200** lines of Go source across 17 packages
